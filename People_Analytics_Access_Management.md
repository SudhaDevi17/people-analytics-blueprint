# Access Management for People Analytics Data

Effective access management is essential to ensure the security, privacy, and integrity of People Analytics data. This document outlines the principles, roles, processes, and security measures for managing access to sensitive people data.

## Principles of Access Management

- **Least Privilege:** Users are granted the minimum level of access necessary to perform their job functions.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Access rights are assigned based on user roles (e.g., HR, People Analytics team, business leaders).
- **Data Privacy and Compliance:** All access is governed by data privacy laws and organizational policies (e.g., GDPR, local regulations).
- **Auditability:** All access and data usage are logged and regularly reviewed.

## Access Roles and Responsibilities

- **System Administrators:**
  - Manage user accounts, permissions, and system configurations.
  - Responsible for implementing and maintaining access controls.

- **People Analytics Team:**
  - Granted access to aggregated and anonymized data for analysis.
  - May request access to specific datasets as needed, subject to approval.

- **HR Business Partners:**
  - Access to employee data relevant to their business unit or function.
  - Cannot access data outside their scope without additional authorization.

- **Business Leaders/Executives:**
  - Receive dashboards and reports with aggregated insights.
  - No direct access to raw or personally identifiable data.

- **Employees:**
  - Can access their own personal data and relevant self-service analytics.

## Access Management Processes

1. **User Provisioning:**
   - New users are granted access based on their role and business need.
   - Access requests are reviewed and approved by data owners or HR leadership.

2. **Periodic Access Reviews:**
   - Regular audits of user access to ensure appropriateness and compliance.
   - Revocation of access for users who change roles or leave the organization.

3. **Data Segmentation and Masking:**
   - Sensitive data is segmented and masked to prevent unauthorized access.
   - Only authorized users can view personally identifiable information (PII).

4. **Monitoring and Logging:**
   - All access to People Analytics data is logged.
   - Unusual or unauthorized access attempts are flagged and investigated.

## Security Measures

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Required for all users accessing sensitive data.
- **Encryption:** Data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
- **Secure Access Channels:** Use of VPNs or secure connections for remote access.
- **Incident Response:** Defined procedures for responding to data breaches or unauthorized access.
